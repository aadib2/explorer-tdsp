## 📊 Project Overview

This project focused on analyzing traffic collision data from the [NYC OpenData Portal](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/), with the goal of uncovering data-driven insights that could inform safer and more efficient urban road design.

In the guided modules, using exploratory data analysis, time series and geospatial techniques, I explored patterns and trends in traffic collisions across New York City. The project culminated in a self-defined research investigation where I looked into **collision hotspots in Manhattan**, examining contributing factors and proposing actionable insights.

## 🧪 Self-Guided Research Questions

> _"What impact does Manhattan's dense population, high pedestrian activity, and growing network of bike lanes have on traffic accident frequency and severity?"_

This self-directed investigation aimed to explore:

- How do traffic collisions and their severity in **Manhattan** compare to those in other boroughs?
- What relationships exist between **pedestrian/cyclist density** and **crash outcomes**?
- Where are the **collision hotspots** located, and how have these shifted **over time**?
- How might insights from Manhattan inform **broader traffic safety planning** for NYC?

---

## 🔍 Key Findings

- Identified high-risk zones in Manhattan where pedestrian and cyclist collision rates were disproportionately high
- Found strong correlations between time-of-day and crash severity in densely trafficked areas
- Uncovered seasonal patterns linked to elevated crash risks through time series analysis
- Generated 8+ visualizations to communicate insights, including:
  - Geospatial heatmaps of collision density (via Folium)
  - Time series plots of crash frequency by month in Manhattan zip codes with highest number of crashes
  - Comparative bar charts of injury types by borough
