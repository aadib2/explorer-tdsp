This project centers around leveraging a NYC OpenData Transportation Dataset and learning to leverage data science tools, include time series and geospatial tecniques, to identify data-driven insights on how roads can be made safer for not just NYC residents but for all. At the end, I had the opportunity to craft my own research question, exploring traffic collision hotspots in Manhattan and investigating into various relationships and causes, consequently summarizing my recommendations and insights into a virtual poster board.

Skills Gained: Python Programming, Data Analysis and Visualization, Time Series / Geospatial Analysis
