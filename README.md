## üìä Project Overview

This project focused on analyzing traffic collision data from the [NYC OpenData Portal](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/), with the goal of uncovering data-driven insights that could inform safer and more efficient urban road design. Access dataset used [here](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95/about_data).

In the guided modules, using exploratory data analysis, time series and geospatial techniques, I explored patterns and trends in traffic collisions across New York City. The project culminated in a self-defined research investigation where I looked into **collision hotspots in Manhattan**, examining contributing factors and proposing actionable insights.

## üß™ Self-Guided Research Questions

> _"What impact does Manhattan's dense population, high pedestrian activity, and growing network of bike lanes have on traffic accident frequency and severity?"_

This self-directed investigation aimed to explore:

- How do traffic collisions and their severity in **Manhattan** compare to those in other boroughs?
- What relationships exist between **pedestrian/cyclist density** and **crash outcomes**?
- Where are the **collision hotspots** located, and how have these shifted **over time**?
- How might insights from Manhattan inform **broader traffic safety planning** for NYC?

## üîç Key Findings

- Identified high-risk zip codes (10016, 10019, 10036) all located in midtown Manhattam where frequency of crashes were the highest between ~2013-2025
- Found strong correlations between time-of-day and crash severity in densely trafficked areas
- Uncovered seasonal patterns linked to elevated crash risks through time series analysis
- Generated 8+ visualizations to communicate insights, including:
  - Geospatial heatmaps of collision density (via Folium)
  - Time series plots of crash frequency by month in high risk zip codes
  - Comparative bar charts of crash type frequencies by borough
